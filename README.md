# **Introduction**
  
This my third project undertaken as part of the [Code Institute Full Stack Diploma Course](https://codeinstitute.net)  
   
It is a version of the classic board game **Connect4**, implmented using the Python coding language and deployed via heroku to the web.  

It was designed by Wexler and Strongin and **NOT** as I believed for many years by [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie) which is an urban myth.  

The game was first sold in 1974 by MB games of Springfield MA.  It was a global success and spawned many spin-offs and variations.
  
The rules are simple, each player has 21 checkers of the same colour, either red or yellow in the original game.  The players take turns placing their checkers into a 6 by 7 
grid, the grid is suspended vertically and the pieces drop to the first available position.  

The winner is the first player to connect a line of four of their particular colour.  

If neither player connects a line of four before the grid is full then the game is a draw.  

More information regarding the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
